# Developed an Android application which is able to fetch Wireless Access Point Information and display it on a user's screen. Also, application has an easy to use "logging" system, which can store access point data in a text file to aid in collecting data for WiFi Fingerprinting. Also, the application has a feature which allows for files to be uploaded automatically to Grail server.
